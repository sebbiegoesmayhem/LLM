# Time Series Analysis Implementation Summary

## Architecture Overview

We've implemented a modern web application for time series data analysis with the following architecture:

1. **Frontend (React/Next.js on Vercel)**
   - React with Next.js for the user interface
   - Material UI for components and styling
   - Plotly.js for interactive data visualization
   - API client for communicating with the backend

2. **Backend (Python/FastAPI on Render)**
   - FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
   - Pandas and PyArrow for data processing
   - DuckDB for efficient data querying
   - Redis for caching with TTL-based auto-delete

3. **Data Flow**
   - User uploads CSV (up to 25MB) â†’ Backend converts to Parquet
   - Parquet is stored in Upstash Redis with TTL-based auto-delete
   - When user applies filters, backend queries Redis, loads Parquet into DuckDB
   - Only filtered data is sent back to frontend for faster response
   - Data auto-deletes after TTL, keeping storage cost-free

## Key Features Implemented

### Frontend
- Enhanced file upload component supporting files up to 25MB
- Progress indicator for file uploads
- Data retention selection (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week)
- Flexible filtering interface for querying data
- TTL indicator showing when data will expire
- Visualization components for filtered data

### Backend
- FastAPI application with structured routers and utilities
- CSV to Parquet conversion using Pandas and PyArrow
- Redis integration with TTL-based auto-delete
- Chunked storage for large datasets
- DuckDB for efficient data querying
- API endpoints for data filtering and querying

## Benefits of the New Architecture

1. **Cost Efficiency**
   - No persistent storage costs (data auto-deletes after TTL)
   - Serverless deployment on Vercel (frontend) and Render (backend)
   - Redis cache with TTL keeps storage costs minimal

2. **Performance**
   - Parquet format for efficient storage and querying
   - DuckDB for high-performance data analysis
   - Only filtered data sent to frontend for faster rendering

3. **Scalability**
   - Separation of frontend and backend concerns
   - Stateless architecture allows for horizontal scaling
   - Background processing for CPU-intensive tasks

4. **User Experience**
   - Immediate feedback during file upload
   - Flexible filtering options
   - Fast response times for data visualization

## Deployment Instructions

The application can be deployed using:
- Vercel for the frontend
- Render for the backend
- Upstash Redis for caching

Detailed deployment instructions are provided in the README.md file.
